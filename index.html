      <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Govinda Ray</span></h1>
      <h3>Senior Flutter Developer | Cross-Platform Mobile Architect</h3>

      <p>
        I am a highly dedicated and performance-driven Senior Flutter Developer with over <strong>3+ years of hands-on industry experience</strong>
        in designing, developing, and deploying scalable mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms.
        My professional journey includes working on <strong>Government of India health systems, international NGO platforms,
        startup ecosystems, and enterprise-grade applications</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I specialize in building secure, API-driven, real-time enabled applications that handle
        thousands of active users efficiently. From system architecture planning to UI implementation,
        backend integration, testing, optimization, and final deployment — I manage the complete
        product lifecycle with precision and quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core focus areas include clean architecture, scalable code structure,
        performance optimization, smooth user experience, and long-term maintainability.
        I believe mobile applications are not just software — they are digital products that must
        deliver measurable business impact.

    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>

    <p>
      I am a passionate and results-oriented Flutter Developer with extensive experience
      in building high-performance, secure, and user-friendly mobile applications.
      Over the past 3+ years, I have contributed to multiple production-level applications
      that are actively used by government departments, NGOs, private organizations,
      and consumer markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      My technical expertise includes Flutter & Dart development, RESTful API integration,
      Firebase ecosystem (Authentication, Firestore, FCM, Crashlytics), real-time chat systems,
      voice & video calling integration, payment gateway implementation, and deployment pipelines.
      I have strong experience working with backend teams using Laravel and other API frameworks
      to ensure smooth data flow and system reliability.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have successfully developed applications involving:
      <ul>
        <li>Healthcare management systems for Government institutions</li>
        <li>International water purification tracking platforms</li>
        <li>Live consultation & astrology platforms with chat and call features</li>
        <li>Job portals and service-based applications</li>
        <li>Wallet systems, reward mechanisms, and secure payment integrations</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond development, I actively focus on performance profiling, debugging complex issues,
      fixing production crashes, improving UI responsiveness, and maintaining clean version control
      using Git & GitHub. I am comfortable working independently, leading modules,
      or collaborating in team-based agile environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to build impactful digital products that are scalable, secure,
      and aligned with real-world business requirements. I continuously learn new technologies
      and improve my development practices to deliver better and more efficient solutions.
